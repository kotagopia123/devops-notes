Shell Script Assignment - 1:
Write shell script for the following Pseudo codes:

#1: Write pseudo code that reads two numbers and multiplies them together and print out their product.

#!/bin/bash

#Multiplication
read -p "Enter First Number - " first
read -p "Enter Second Number - " second
mul=`expr $first \* $second`
echo "The product of the Two Numbers $first * $second = " $mul


#2: Write pseudo code that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6

#!/bin/bash
# Whether the given Number is not 5 or 6

read -p "Enter Number - " num
if [ $num -eq 5 -o $num -eq 6 ]
then
    echo "The Entered Number is (5/6) " $num
else
	echo "The Entered Number is not 5 or 6 "
fi

#3: Write pseudo code that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the number is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word red. if the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number, write that it is not a correct color option.

#!/bin/bash
# Code Options

read -p "Enter Number - " num
if [ $num -gt 0 -a $num -lt 10 ]
then 
	echo "Blue"
elif [ $num -gt 10 -a $num -lt 20 ]
then 
	echo "Red"
elif [ $num -gt 20 -a $num -lt 30 ]
then 
	echo "Green"
else
	echo "It is not Color Option"
fi


#4: Write pseudo code to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and 100 (including both 1 and 100)

#!/bin/bash
#Multiplication of 5
num=1
value=1
while [ $value -lt 100 ]
do
	value=`expr 5 \* $num`
	echo "5 * $num = " $value
	num=`expr $num + 1`
done


#5: Write pseudo code that will count all the even numbers up to a user defined stopping point. For example, say we want to see the first 5 even numbers starting from 0. well, we know that evens numbers are 0, 2, 4, etc. The first 5 even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. The first 8 even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ,10 ,12, 16

#!/bin/bash
#Printing First n number of Even Numvers

read -p "Enter the Number - " num
i=0
evenNumber=0
echo "The First $num of Even Numbers Are - "
while [ $i -lt $num ]
do
	echo "" $evenNumber
	i=`expr $i + 1` 
	evenNumber=`expr $evenNumber + 2`
done
